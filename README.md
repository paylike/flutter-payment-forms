## Library navigator

This library was created to provide the simpliest way of integrating Paylike into your application. It provides a simple way to create a payment form and a simple way to handle the payment result.

If you are looking for our low level library supporting executing payments through our API, you are looking for our [Engine](https://github.com/paylike/flutter-engine) which is responsible for making the API integration including the webview required to execute TDS challenges
